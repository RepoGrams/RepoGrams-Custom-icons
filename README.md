# RepoGrams â€” Custom icons #

This repository contains the custom icons for [RepoGrams](https://github.com/RepoGrams/RepoGrams).
The `/strokes` directory contains easily editable versions of the icons, while the `/icons` directory contains the
same icons as SVG paths that can be converted to font-based icons using icomoon.

To convert a stroke to a path: using Inkscape, do `Path -> Stroke to Path` in the main menu.

To create font-based icons, use [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app). Import all SVG icons (make sure you import the
SVGs with paths, not strokes) and click on Generate Font. Rename the icons if needed and download the result. Unzip it
and copy the files to the main RepoGrams project.

This is a manual process for now, but if adding and changing custom icons become common practice in the development of
RepoGrams we will automate.
